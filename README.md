This Is the first project I have made on The Odin Project. I will be demonstrating all of the skills I have acquired in the HTML section of the course for example: Writing headers, Writing paragraphs, Using ordered and unordered lists, including links and pictures on the website.

I will review what has been covered and reflect on what can be improved upon at the end of the project.
